# 2023-CVPR-FCMI
This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of [Deep Fair Clustering via Maximizing and Minimizing Mutual Information: Theory, Algorithm and Metric (CVPR 2023)](https://github.com/PengxinZeng?tab=repositories). 

Currently, one of our studies, which is closely related to this work, is under review.  Hence, the code, as well as the checkpoints, will remain unreleased until the acceptance of the study.
